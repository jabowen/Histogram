Summery:
    This repository creates a histogram with a random data set. 
Data Set:
    The data set is made up of x random integers between 0 and 100. X is a random integer between 0 and 1000.
Fields and Buttons:
    Input: allows the user to enter their own dataset as a comma seprated list. The scale of the x and y axis will automatically adjust to the new data set
    Submit: submits the new data set
    No Axis/Axis: togglable button that turns on or off visible axis
    Shuffle: creates a new random data set
    X Scale: toggles between "Flex" and "Bucket". "Bucket" uses buckets of the size of the x scale, while "Flex" has a bucket size of 1 number.
Colors:
    The color of each bucket is mostly randomly selected and is regenerated each time a button is pressed. It is mostly random becuase the red and green values are randomly generated, while the blue is a function of position. This creates a smoother color gradiant, while also making sure no two bars are exactly the same color.
